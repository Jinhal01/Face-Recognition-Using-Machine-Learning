# Face Recognition Using Machine Learning
## Introduction
Face recognition using machine learning is a cutting-edge technology that identifies and verifies individuals based on their facial features. It employs machine learning algorithms to extract and compare facial characteristics from videos. This process involves data collection, feature extraction, model training, recognition, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used
- **OpenCv:** To capture and process video for real time detection.
- **scikit-learn:** To import machine learning libraries.
- **numpy:** To operate on the data in form of array.
- **PIL:** To access the images stored in the dataset using their paths.
- **os:** To get the paths and names of the images stored in the dataset.
- **collections:** To count the occurences of an element in a given array.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Dump the code on raspberry pi.
4. Run the dataset.py file for capturing the training data.
5. Run main.py file to train using LBPH algorithm. Run svm.py file to train using SVM algorithm.
6. Run recognizer.py file to execute the facial recognition task.

## Usage
- **Identification and Authentication:**: Verifying individuals' identities through facial features for secure access and authentication purposes.
- **Surveillance and Monitoring:**: Tracking and identifying individuals in real-time video feeds for security and public safety applications.
- **Personalization and User Experience:**: Tailoring services and content based on facial recognition data to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
- **Biometric Identification and Forensics:**: Utilizing facial recognition for matching faces in databases, aiding criminal investigations, and forensic analysis.
